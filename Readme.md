Functional Programming:

- lazy evaluation: less garbage, efficient
- beautiful syntax

Pure functions: 
 - pure functions on can be evaluated lazily
 - pure function returns the same result any no of times it's called with same input (idempotency)
 - pure functions don't have any side effects
    1. they don't change anything
    2. they don't depend on anything that can change
    
 - immutable
